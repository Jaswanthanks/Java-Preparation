## 💼 Commission & Student Management - Java Project

A beginner-friendly Java application showcasing the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** such as **Encapsulation**, **Class Design**, **Getters/Setters**, and **Conditional Logic** to calculate sales commissions. This project also includes a simple `Student` class to demonstrate object instantiation and method invocation.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This mini project consists of two main modules:

- 📊 **Commission Calculation**  
  Determines commission based on sales amount using tiered logic.

- 🎓 **Student Class**  
  A basic class demonstrating object creation and method invocation.

## 🧩 Project Structure

Assigment2/
├── Commission.java // Commission logic with encapsulated data
├── Student.java // Simple class with a display method
└── Main.java // Main driver class to execute the program


---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Clean, modular Java class design (`Commission`, `Student`, `Main`)
- ✅ Adheres to OOP principles: encapsulation, abstraction
- ✅ Commission logic with multiple sales brackets
- ✅ Friendly output via `System.out.println`
- ✅ Easy-to-run setup for beginners

## 💰 Commission Calculation Logic

| Sales Amount Range       | Commission Rate |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| ≥ ₹100,000               | 10%              |
| ₹50,000 – ₹99,999        | 5%               |
| ₹30,000 – ₹49,999        | 3%               |
| < ₹30,000                | 0%               |

## 🧪 Sample Output

Student object is created
Commission for Jash: ₹4000.0
